To compile on your mac or linux do this:

1. Locate your cpgplot.h file and libpgplot and libcpgplot libraries
2. Edit makeit and change paths to these
3. Type "makeit"
4. Place mbplot in a bin directory in your path somewhere.

To use mbplot:

Create a file like the example "cat"

It should consist of N columns by M values. It is not essential
for all of these values to be valid floating point numbers. They
can even be names if you like. They must not consist of more than
one word.

The top of the file is your column labels for plotting.

So a file like:

N  x   y    z    name
1 1.2  2.3  2.3  FREDDY
2 8.2  5.6  8.2  JACK
3 *    8.3  9.2  LEMON
4 3.4  -2.3  9.0 LAST

Is just fine.

If this file was called "data" just say mbplot data.

Choose your X and y axes, whether to log them or not
and plot away.
